# Amber Machine Learning Engineer Exercise (Oct 2022)

Thank you for taking the time to complete Amber's Machine Learning Engineer Exercise. In this exercise, we are providing you with sample data on which we would like you to perform some minor data engineering and use the cleansed data to build a prediction model.

Throughout this exercise you will:
* Clean the data and prepare it for training
* Using your favorite python framework/library to create a model that can predict power consumption over the next 24hr for a single customer
* Write a description of how you've chosen to model the data
* A small description and sample code that shows how you've verified, cleaned and normalised data
* Visualisation and results of your model

### Submission:
You should use python as the authoring language here and your answer should be submitted as a git repository with a notebook that can be run offline, please include all requirements via either poetry or a requirements.txt to make it as easy as possible for us to verify your solution. Include in your notebook any supporting information that can help identify how you've approached the problem, this will be used to drive discussion in the technical interview process should you be successful.

_Note: Please do not share your work on github or any other publicly accessible space. We'd like to ensure that the test remains fair for all applicants_

### Instructions
Please open the [notebook](exercise.ipynb) which contains all the information about how the data is formatted along with the exercise description and a series of short answer questions. You will then need to download the data we've provided which you can locate [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/el6rcqk69ouxngb/TestData.zip?dl=0).

**You should spend approximately 3hrs on the exercise.** Don't focus too much on the performance of the model instead provide as much descriptive & supporting evidence about your approach. We encourage you to use any open source libraries or modelling tools to help generate your predictions.

Best of luck ðŸ˜„
